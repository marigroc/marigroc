ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @marigroc

Curiosity led me to data engineering, and I got excellent hands-on, project-based training from AiCore.

This was an excellent opportunity to learn new things and, personally, the humbling realization of how much there is to know.
I'd love you to look at the repos I have created so far.
